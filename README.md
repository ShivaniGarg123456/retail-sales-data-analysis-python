🛒 Retail Sales Data Analysis (Python)
📌 Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset using Python.
The goal is to understand sales performance, customer behavior, product category trends, and derive business insights that can support future planning.

📂 Dataset Information

Source: Kaggle (Retail Sales Dataset)

File type: CSV (single file)

Records: 1000 rows

Columns: 9

Dataset Columns:

Transaction ID

Date

Customer ID

Gender

Age

Product Category

Quantity

Price per Unit

Total Amount

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Data Understanding & Preparation

The following steps were performed:

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Checked shape, columns, and data types

Converted the Date column to datetime format

Verified missing values (dataset contained no missing values)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis includes:

Sales Analysis

Total sales across all transactions

Sales by product category

Category-wise average order value

Quantity sold vs revenue per category

Customer Analysis

Gender-wise sales distribution

Age-wise spending patterns

Top 10 customers by total spending

Time-Based Analysis

Monthly sales trend analysis

Identification of sales fluctuations over time

📈 Data Visualization

Simple visualizations were created to support insights:

Bar charts for category-wise and gender-wise sales

Line chart for monthly sales trend

Histogram for sales and age distribution

Scatter plot for quantity vs total sales

💡 Key Insights

Electronics is the highest revenue-generating product category.

High total sales do not always imply high average order value.

A small number of customers contribute significantly to total revenue.

Sales show variation across months, indicating possible seasonality.

Some categories sell higher quantities but generate comparatively lower revenue.

🔮 Basic Sales Forecasting

The project applies basic forecasting logic, including:

Monthly aggregation of sales

Trend analysis using line plots

Moving average for short-term sales estimation

Note: This forecasting is indicative and based only on historical patterns.

📌 Business Use Case

The analysis helps in:

Identifying high-performing product categories

Understanding customer contribution to revenue

Supporting inventory and sales planning

Highlighting areas for revenue optimization

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used for structured data analysis and insight generation.
It reflects a foundational Data Analyst workflow, covering data understanding, EDA, visualization, and business interpretation.
