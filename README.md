 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Sales Analysis

Total sales overview

Product category-wise sales

Category-wise average order value

Quantity vs revenue comparison

 Customer Analysis

Gender-wise sales distribution

Age-wise spending behavior

Top 10 customers by total spending

Time-Based Analysis

 Visualizations

 Simple and meaningful plots were created:

Bar charts (category-wise & gender-wise sales)

 Line chart (monthly sales trend)
 
 Histogram (sales & age distribution)

 Scatter plot (quantity vs total amount)

💡 Key Business Insights

✔ Electronics is the highest revenue-generating category
✔ High sales volume does not always mean high average order value
✔ Revenue is concentrated among a few top customers
✔ Monthly sales fluctuations indicate possible seasonality
✔ Some categories sell more units but generate lower revenue

🔮 Basic Sales Forecasting

📍 Forecasting techniques used:

Monthly sales aggregation

Trend analysis using line plots

Moving average for short-term sales estimation

⚠️ Forecasts are indicative and based on historical data only.

📌 Business Value

 This analysis supports:

Better inventory planning

Identification of high-value customers

Product category optimization

Data-driven decision making

Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete beginner-to-intermediate Data Analyst workflow, covering data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and business interpretation using Python.
